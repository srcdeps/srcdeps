# `.mvn/srcdeps.yaml` - the srcdeps configuration file

# Note that this is a minimal srcdeps.yaml file that constains only options relevant for this quickstart.
# For full reference, see `srcdeps.yaml.adoc` in the top level folder of srcdeps source tree.

# `configModelVersion` exists just in case we'll have to change the schema of srcdeps.yaml in the future.
#
# Required, no default, only 1.0 supported at the moment
configModelVersion: 1.0

# `repositories` - a map of SCM repositories.
#
# Required, no default
repositories:

  # the `id` of the source repository, typically the `groupId` of its artifacts,
  # or any other string unique at this level of the yaml file.
  org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps.itest:

    # `selectors` - a way how to map dependency artifacts to source repositories.
    # At the moment, the association is given by the exact string match between the `groupId` of the dependency
    # artifact and one of the selectors listed here.
    #
    # At least one selector is required
    selectors:
    - org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps.itest # This SCM repository entry will be used for building artifacts
                                   # with groupId org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps.itest

    # `urls` - a list of URLs to checkout the sources of the given dependency. If you list multiple SCM
    # repos here then only the first successful checkout will count.
    #
    # At least one URL is required
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/srcdeps/srcdeps-test-artifact.git
