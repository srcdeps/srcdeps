[source,yaml]
----

# `.mvn/srcdeps.yaml` - the srcdeps configuration file.

# `configModelVersion` exists just in case we'll have to change the schema of srcdeps.yaml in the future.
#
# Required, no default, only 1.0 supported at the moment
configModelVersion: 1.0

# `forwardProperties` - used rarely, mostly for debugging.
# A list of property names that the top level builder A should pass as java system properties to every
# dependency builder B using `-DmyProperty=myValue` style command line arguments. Further, in case a child
# builder B spawns its own new child builder C, B must pass all these properties to C in the very same
# manner as A did to B.
#
# A property name may end with asterisk {@code *} to denote that all properties starting with the part before the
# asterisk should be forwared. E.g. {@code my.prop.*} would forward both {@code my.prop.foo} and
# {@code my.prop.bar}.
#
# Optional, not sure if there are defaults - see the code ;)
forwardProperties:
- myForwardProperty

# `builderIo` - a triple of definitions how to handle the three standard I/O steams of the child builder
# process. The syntax of the definitions mostly follows the semantics of
# `java.lang.ProcessBuilder.Redirect`.
#
# Possible values:
# * `inherit` - use the I/O of the parent process; applicable to all three streams
# * `read:/path/to/input/file` - use the specified file for input; applicable to stdin
# * `write:/path/to/output/file` - use the specified file for output; applicable to stdout and stderr
# * `append:/path/to/output/file` - use the specified file for output; applicable to stdout and stderr
# * `err2out` - redirect `stderr` to `stdout`; applicable to stderr
#
# Optional, default is inherit all.
builderIo:
  stdin: inherit
  stdout: inherit
  stderr: inherit

# `skip` - skip srcdeps processing
#
# Optional, default: false
skip: false

# `sourcesDirectory` - A directory where the dependency sources should be checked out. Each SCM repository
# will have a subdirectory named after its `id` there.
#
# Optional, default: `${maven.repo.local}/../srcdeps/` - i.e. usually `~/.m2/srcdeps`
sourcesDirectory: ~/.m2/srcdeps

# `verbosity` - the verbosity level the appropriate dependency build tool (such as Maven) should use
# during the build of a dependency. The interpretation of the individual levels is up to the given build
# tool. Some build tools may map the levels listed here to a distinct set of levels they support
# internally.
#
# Possible values: error, warn, info, debug, trace
#
# Optional, default: warn
verbosity: warn


# `repositories` - a map of SCM repositories.
#
# Required, no default
repositories:

  # the `id` of the source repository, typically the `groupId` of its artifacts,
  # or any other string unique at this level of the yaml file.
  org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps.itest:

    # `selectors` - a way how to map dependency artifacts to source repositories.
    # At the moment, the association is given by the exact string match between the `groupId` of the dependency
    # artifact and one of the selectors listed here.
    #
    # At least one selector is required
    selectors:
    - org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps.itest # This SCM repository entry will be used for building artifacts
                                   # with groupId org.l2x6.maven.srcdeps.itest

    # `urls` - a list of URLs to checkout the sources of the given dependency. If you list multiple SCM
    # repos here then only the first successful checkout will count.
    #
    # At least one URL is required
    urls:
    - git:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-commons.git

    # Appended to the list of build tool specific default build arguments. To override the given
    # build tool's defaults, see addDefaultBuildArguments
    #
    # Optional
    buildArguments:
    - -Dcheckstyle.skip=true
    - -Dlicense.skip=true # for skipping the tests, see `skipTests` below, that is BTW `true` by default

    # `addDefaultBuildArguments` - if true, the build tool's default arguments will be used when building
    # a dependency. Otherwise, no default build arguments will be used. The default build arguments are
    # build tool specific.
    #
    # For Maven, the default build arguments are `clean install`.
    #
    # Optional, default: true
    addDefaultBuildArguments: true

    # `skipTests` - if set to `true` no tests will be run when building a dependency. For dependencies built
    # with Maven, this accounts to adding `-DskipTests` to the `mvn` arguments.
    #
    # Optional, default: true
    skipTests: true
